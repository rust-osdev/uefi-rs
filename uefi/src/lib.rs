//! Rusty wrapper for the [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface][UEFI].
//!
//! This crate makes it easy to develop Rust software that leverages **safe**,
//! **convenient**, and **performant** abstractions for [UEFI] functionality.
//!
//! See the [Rust UEFI Book] for a tutorial, how-tos, and overviews of some
//! important UEFI concepts. For more details of UEFI, see the latest [UEFI
//! Specification][spec].
//!
//! # Minimal Example
//!
//! Minimal example for an UEFI application using functionality of the
//! `uefi` crate:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! #![no_main]
//! #![no_std]
//!
//! use uefi::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[entry]
//! fn main() -> Status {
//!     uefi::helpers::init().unwrap();
//!
//!     Status::SUCCESS
//! }
//! # extern crate std; // For panic handler
//! ```
//!
//! Please find more info in our [Rust UEFI Book].
//!
//! # Value-add and Use Cases
//!
//! `uefi` supports writing code for both pre- and post-exit boot services
//! epochs, but its true strength shines when you create UEFI images that heavily
//! interact with UEFI boot services. Still, you have the flexibility to just
//! integrate selected types and abstractions into your project, for example to
//! parse the UEFI memory map.
//!
//! _Note that for producing UEFI images, you also need to use a corresponding
//! `uefi` compiler target of Rust, such as `x86_64-unknown-uefi`._
//!
//! ## Example Use Cases
//!
//! This library significantly simplifies the process of creating **UEFI images**
//! by abstracting away much of the UEFI API complexity and by providing
//! convenient wrappers. When we mention UEFI images, we are talking about UEFI
//! applications, UEFI boot service drivers, and EFI runtime service drivers,
//! which typically have the `.efi` file extension. For instance, an UEFI
//! application could be an OS-specific loader, similar to _GRUB_ or _Limine_.
//!
//! Additionally, you can use this crate in non-UEFI images (such as a kernel
//! in ELF format) to perform tasks like parsing the UEFI memory map embedded in
//! the boot information provided by a bootloader. It also enables access to
//! UEFI runtime services from a non-UEFI image kernel.
//!
//! # Supported Compiler Versions and Architectures
//!
//! `uefi` works with stable Rust, but additional nightly-only features are
//! gated behind the `unstable` Cargo feature. Please find more information
//! about additional crate features below.
//!
//! `uefi` is compatible with all platforms that both the Rust compiler and
//! UEFI support, such as `i686`, `x86_64`, and `aarch64`. Please note that we
//! can't test all possible hardware/firmware/platform combinations in CI.
//!
//! ## MSRV
//! <!-- Keep in Sync with README! -->
//!
//! The minimum supported Rust version is currently 1.70.
//! Our policy is to support at least the past two stable releases.
//!
//! # API/User Documentation, Documentation Structure, and other Resources
//!
//! Down below, you find typical technical documentation of all types, modules,
//! and functions exported by `uefi`.
//!
//! For a TL;DR quick start with an example on how to create your own EFI
//! application, please check out [the UEFI application template][template]. The
//! [Rust UEFI Book] is a more beginner-friendly tutorial with How-Tos, and
//! overviews of some important UEFI concepts and the abstractions provided by
//! this library.
//!
//! For more details of UEFI itself, see the latest [UEFI Specification][spec].
//!
//! # Library Structure & Tips
//!
//! The top-level module contains some of the most used types and macros,
//! including the [`Handle`] and [`Result`] types, the [`CStr16`] and
//! [`CString16`] types for working with UCS-2 strings, and the [`entry`] and
//! [`guid`] macros.
//!
//! ## UEFI Strings
//!
//! Rust string literals are UTF-8 encoded and thus, not compatible with most
//! UEFI interfaces. We provide [`CStr16`] and [`CString16`] for proper working
//! with UCS-2 strings, including various transformation functions from standard
//! Rust strings. You can use [`ctr16!`] to create UCS-2 string literals at
//! compile time.
//!
//! ## Tables
//!
//! Most UEFI functionality comes from the system, boot, and runtime
//! tables. These can be accessed via the [`system`], [`boot`], and [`runtime`]
//! modules.
//!
//! ## Protocols
//!
//! When boot services are active, most functionality is provided via UEFI
//! protocols. Protocols provide operations such as reading and writing files,
//! drawing to the screen, sending and receiving network requests, and much
//! more. The list of protocols that are actually available when running an
//! application depends on the device. For example, a PC with no network card
//! may not provide network protocols.
//!
//! See the [`boot`] documentation for details of how to open a
//! protocol, and see the [`proto`] module for protocol implementations. New
//! protocols can be defined with the [`unsafe_protocol`] macro.
//!
//! ## Optional Cargo crate features
//!
//! - `alloc`: Enable functionality requiring the [`alloc`] crate from
//!   the Rust standard library. For example, methods that return a
//!   `Vec` rather than filling a statically-sized array. This requires
//!   a global allocator; you can use the `global_allocator` feature or
//!   provide your own. This is independent of internal direct usages of the
//!   UEFI boot service allocator which may happen anyway, where necessary.
//! - `global_allocator`: Set [`allocator::Allocator`] as the global Rust
//!   allocator. This is a simple allocator that relies on the UEFI pool
//!   allocator. You can choose to provide your own allocator instead of
//!   using this feature, or no allocator at all if you don't need to
//!   dynamically allocate any memory.
//! - `logger`: Logging implementation for the standard [`log`] crate
//!   that prints output to the UEFI console. No buffering is done; this
//!   is not a high-performance logger.
//! - `panic_handler`: Add a default panic handler that logs to `stdout`.
//! - `unstable`: Enable functionality that depends on [unstable
//!   features] in the nightly compiler.
//!   As example, in conjunction with the `alloc`-feature, this gate allows
//!   the `allocator_api` on certain functions.
//! - `qemu`: Enable some code paths to adapt their execution when executed
//!   in QEMU, such as using the special `qemu-exit` device when the panic
//!   handler is called.
//!
//! Some of these features, such as the `logger` or `panic_handler` features,
//! only unfold their potential when you invoke `uefi::helpers::init` as soon
//! as possible in your application.
//!
//! # Discuss and Contribute
//!
//! For general discussions, feel free to join us in our [Zulip] and ask
//! your questions there.
//!
//! Further, you can submit bugs and also ask questions in our [issue tracker].
//! Contributions in the form of a PR are also highly welcome. Check our
//! [contributing guide][contributing] for details.
//!
//! # Comparison to other Projects in the Ecosystem
//!
//! ## Rust `std` implementation
//!
//! There is an ongoing effort for a [`std` implementation][rustc-uefi-std] of
//! the Rust standard library, which allows you to write UEFI programs that look
//! very similar to normal Rust programs running on top of an OS.
//!
//! It is still under development. You can track the progress in the
//! corresponding [tracking issue][uefi-std-tr-issue].
//!
//! Using the `std` implementation simplifies the overall process of producing
//! the binary. For example, our [`#[entry]`][entry-macro] macro won't be
//! required any longer. As the `std` implementation evolves over time, you'll
//! need fewer and fewer abstractions of this crate. For everything not covered
//! by the `std` implementation, you can obtain relevant structures to work with
//! our crate via:
//! - `std::os::uefi::env::boot_services()`
//! - `std::os::uefi::env::get_system_handle()`
//! - `std::os::uefi::env::get_system_table()`
//!
//! ## `r-efi`
//!
//! [`r-efi`] provides Raw UEFI bindings without high-level convenience similar
//! to our `uefi-raw` crate, which is part of this  project, but more
//! feature-complete. It targets a lower-level than our `uefi` crate does.
