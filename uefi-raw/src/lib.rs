//! Raw interface for working with UEFI.
//!
//! This crate is intended for implementing UEFI services. It is also used for
//! implementing the [`uefi`] crate, which provides a safe wrapper around UEFI.
//!
//! For creating UEFI applications and drivers, consider using the [`uefi`]
//! crate instead of `uefi-raw`.
