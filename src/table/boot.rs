/// # Accessing protocols
///
/// Protocols can be opened using several methods of `BootServices`. Most
/// commonly, [`open_protocol_exclusive`] should be used. This ensures that
/// nothing else can use the protocol until it is closed, and returns a
/// [`ScopedProtocol`] that takes care of closing the protocol when it is
/// dropped.
///
/// Other methods for opening protocols:
///
/// * [`open_protocol`]
/// * [`get_image_file_system`]
/// * [`handle_protocol`]
/// * [`locate_protocol`]
///
/// For protocol definitions, see the [`proto`] module.

///
/// ## Use of [`UnsafeCell`] for protocol references
///
/// Some protocols require mutable access to themselves. For example,
/// most of the methods of the [`Output`] protocol take `&mut self`,
/// because the internal function pointers specified by UEFI for that
/// protocol take a mutable `*This` pointer. We don't want to directly
/// return a mutable reference to a protocol though because the lifetime
/// of the protocol is tied to `BootServices`. (That lifetime improves
/// safety by ensuring protocols aren't accessed after exiting boot
/// services.) If methods like [`open_protocol`] protocol took a mutable
/// reference to `BootServices` and returned a mutable reference to a
/// protocol it would prevent all other access to `BootServices` until
/// the protocol reference was dropped. To work around this, the
/// protocol reference is wrapped in an [`UnsafeCell`]. Callers can then
/// get a mutable reference to the protocol if needed.
