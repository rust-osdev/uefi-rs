//! Configuration table utilities.
//!
//! The configuration table is an array of GUIDs and pointers to extra system tables.
//!
//! For example, it can be used to find the ACPI tables.
//!
//! This module contains the actual entries of the configuration table,
//! as well as GUIDs for many known vendor tables.
