## Description

[UEFI] is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for
OS loaders, hypervisors and other low-level applications. While it started out
as x86-specific, it has been adopted on other platforms, such as ARM.

This crate makes it easy to both:
  - Write UEFI applications in Rust (for `i686`, `x86_64`, or `aarch64`)
  - Call UEFI functions from an OS (usually built with a [custom target][rustc-custom])

The objective is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI interfaces,
and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

Check out @gil0mendes [blog post on getting started with UEFI in Rust][gm-blog].

**Note**: this crate currently has only been tested with **64-bit** UEFI on x86/ARM.

## Project structure

This project contains multiple sub-crates:

- `uefi` (top directory): defines the standard UEFI tables / interfaces.
  The objective is to stay unopionated and safely wrap most interfaces.

  Optional features:
  - `alloc`: implements a global allocator using UEFI functions.
    - This allows you to allocate objects on the heap.
    - There's no guarantee of the efficiency of UEFI's allocator.
  - `logger`: logging implementation for the standard [log] crate.
    - Prints output to console.
    - No buffering is done: this is not a high-performance logger.
  - `exts`: extensions providing utility functions for common patterns.
    - Requires the `alloc` crate (either enable the `alloc` optional feature or your own custom allocator).

- `uefi-macros`: procedural macros that are used to derive some traits in `uefi`.

- `uefi-services`: provides a panic handler, and initializes the `alloc` / `logger` features.

- `uefi-test-runner`: a UEFI application that runs unit / integration tests.

## Building kernels which use UEFI

This crate makes it easy to start building simple applications with UEFI.
However, there are some limitations you should be aware of:

- The global logger / allocator **can only be set once** per binary.
  It is useful when just starting out, but if you're building a real OS you will
  want to write your own specific kernel logger and memory allocator.

- To support advanced features such as [higher half kernel] and [linker scripts]
  you will want to build your kernel as an ELF binary.

In other words, the best way to use this crate is to create a small binary which
wraps your actual kernel, and then use UEFI's convenient functions for loading
it from disk and booting it.

This is similar to what the Linux kernel's [EFI stub] does: the compressed kernel
is an ELF binary which has little knowledge of how it's booted, and the boot loader
uses UEFI to set up an environment for it.

## Documentation

The docs for the latest published crate version can be found at
[docs.rs/uefi/](https://docs.rs/uefi/)

This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

## Sample code

An example UEFI app is built in the `uefi-test-runner` directory.

Check out the testing [README.md](uefi-test-runner/README.md) for instructions on how to run the crate's tests.

## Building UEFI programs
