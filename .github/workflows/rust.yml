  # This job tests that the template app builds successfully with the
  # released versions of the libraries on crates.io.
  #
  # Since a nightly toolchain is currently required to build uefi-rs,
  # the released versions can suddenly stop building when a new nightly
  # compiler with a breaking change is released. This job provides an
  # alert when this situation occurs.
