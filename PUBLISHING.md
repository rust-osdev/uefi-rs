# Publishing new versions of uefi-rs to Crates.io

This guide documents the best practices for publishing new versions of
the crates in this repository to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

**It is mostly intended for maintainers of the uefi-rs project.**

## Bumping the crate versions

For ensuring compatibility within the crates ecosystem,
Cargo [recommends][cargo-semver] maintainers to follow the [semantic versioning][semver] guidelines.

This means that before publishing the changes, we need to decide
which crates were modified and how should their version numbers be incremented.

Incrementing the version number of a crate is as simple as editing
the corresponding `Cargo.toml` file and updating the `version = ...` line,
then commiting the change (preferrably on a new branch, so that all of the version bumps
can be combined in a single pull request).

### Crate dependencies

The dependency graph of the published crates in this repo is:

- `uefi-services` depends on `uefi` (the root project)
- `uefi` depends on `uefi-macros`

If there are breaking changes happening in the project, we should first publish
a new version of `uefi-macros`, then of `uefi`, then of `uefi-services` and so on.

For example, if the signature of a widely-used macro from `uefi-macros` is changed,
a new major version of that crate will have to be published, then a new version of
`uefi` (major if the previous bump caused changes in the public API of this crate as well),
then possibly a new version of `uefi-services`.

Furthermore, `uefi-macros` has the `uefi` crate as a `dev-dependency`,
and that will have to be updated in tandem with the major versions of the core crate.

### Updating the dependent crates

Remember that if a new major version of a crate gets released, when bumping the version
of it's dependents you will have to also change the dependency line for it.

For example, if `uefi-macros` gets bumped from `1.1.0` to `2.0.0`,
you will also have to update the corresponding `Cargo.toml` of `uefi` to be:

```toml
uefi-macros = "2.0.0"
```

The dependencies in `template/Cargo.toml` should also be updated to the new version.

## Publishing new versions of the crates

This section is mostly a summary of the official [guide to publishing on crates.io][cargo-publishing-reference],
with a few remarks regarding the specific of this project.

Start by following the steps in the guide. When running `cargo publish`,
you will have to use a custom `--target` flag to be able to build/verify the crates:

```
cargo publish --target x86_64-unknown-uefi
```

## Updating the changelog

After bumping the crate versions, we should also update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file
in order to move all the unpublished changes to their respective version, and prepare it for
tracking further changes. The date of the release should be included next to the section title as
done for the other releases.
