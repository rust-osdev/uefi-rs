//! Rusty wrapper for the [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface][UEFI].
//!
//! # TL;DR
//!
//! Develop Rust software that leverages **safe**, **convenient**, and
//! **performant** abstractions for [UEFI] functionality.
//!
//! See the [Rust UEFI Book] for a tutorial, how-tos, and overviews of some
//! important UEFI concepts. For more details of UEFI, see the latest [UEFI
//! Specification][spec].
//!
//! Feel free to file bug reports and questions in our [issue tracker], and [PR
//! contributions][contributing] are also welcome!
//!
//! # About this Document
//!
//! In this document, you find general information about this crate, such
//! as examples and the technical documentation of the public API, as well
//! as general information about the project, such as license or MSRV
//! requirements.
//!
//! # Interaction with uefi services
//!
//! With this crate you can write code for the pre- and post-exit boot services
//! epochs. However, the `uefi` crate unfolds its true potential when
//! interacting with UEFI boot services.
//!
//! # Crate organisation
//!
//! The top-level module contains some of the most used types and macros,
//! including the [`Handle`] and [`Result`] types, the [`CStr16`] and
//! [`CString16`] types for working with UCS-2 strings, and the [`entry`] and
//! [`guid`] macros.
//!
//! ## Tables
//!
//! The [`SystemTable`] provides access to almost everything in UEFI. It comes
//! in two flavors:
//! - `SystemTable<Boot>`: for boot-time applications such as bootloaders,
//!   provides access to both boot and runtime services.
//! - `SystemTable<Runtime>`: for operating systems after boot services have
//!   been exited.
//!
//! ## Protocols
//!
//! When boot services are active, most functionality is provided via UEFI
//! protocols. Protocols provide operations such as reading and writing files,
//! drawing to the screen, sending and receiving network requests, and much
//! more. The list of protocols that are actually available when running an
//! application depends on the device. For example, a PC with no network card
//! may not provide network protocols.
//!
//! See the [`BootServices`] documentation for details of how to open a
//! protocol, and see the [`proto`] module for protocol implementations. New
//! protocols can be defined with the [`unsafe_protocol`] macro.
//!
//! ## Optional Cargo crate features
//!
//! - `alloc`: Enable functionality requiring the [`alloc`] crate from
//!   the Rust standard library. For example, methods that return a
//!   `Vec` rather than filling a statically-sized array. This requires
//!   a global allocator; you can use the `global_allocator` feature or
//!   provide your own. This is independent of internal direct usages of the
//!   UEFI boot service allocator which may happen anyway, where necessary.
//! - `global_allocator`: Set [`allocator::Allocator`] as the global Rust
//!   allocator. This is a simple allocator that relies on the UEFI pool
//!   allocator. You can choose to provide your own allocator instead of
//!   using this feature, or no allocator at all if you don't need to
//!   dynamically allocate any memory.
//! - `logger`: Logging implementation for the standard [`log`] crate
//!   that prints output to the UEFI console. No buffering is done; this
//!   is not a high-performance logger.
//! - `panic_handler`: Add a default panic handler that logs to `stdout`.
//! - `unstable`: Enable functionality that depends on [unstable
//!   features] in the nightly compiler.
//!   As example, in conjunction with the `alloc`-feature, this gate allows
//!   the `allocator_api` on certain functions.
//! - `qemu`: Enable some code paths to adapt their execution when executed
//!   in QEMU, such as using the special `qemu-exit` device when the panic
//!   handler is called.
//!
//! Some of these features, such as the `logger` or `panic_handler` features,
//! only unfold their potential when you invoke `uefi::helpers::init` as soon
//! as possible in your application.
