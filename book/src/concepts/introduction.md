# Concepts

The canonical source of information about UEFI is the [UEFI specification].
The specification is huge (currently nearly 2500 pages). Much of that
content relates to optional services, understanding of which is not
critical to understanding UEFI as a whole. This chapter summarizes some
of the more important UEFI concepts and links to the relevant `uefi-rs`
documentation.
