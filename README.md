## Description

[UEFI] is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for
OS loaders, hypervisors and other low-level applications. While it started out
as x86-specific, it has been adopted on other platforms, such as ARM.

This crate makes it easy to both:
  - Write UEFI applications in Rust (for `i686`, `x86_64`, or `aarch64`)
  - Call UEFI functions from an OS (usually built with a [custom target][rustc-custom])

The objective is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI interfaces,
and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

Check out [the UEFI application template](template) for a quick start.

## Project structure

This project contains multiple sub-crates:

- `uefi` (top directory): defines the standard UEFI tables / interfaces.
  The objective is to stay unopionated and safely wrap most interfaces.

  Optional features:
  - `alloc`: implements a global allocator using UEFI functions.
    - This allows you to allocate objects on the heap.
    - There's no guarantee of the efficiency of UEFI's allocator.
  - `logger`: logging implementation for the standard [log] crate.
    - Prints output to console.
    - No buffering is done: this is not a high-performance logger.
  - `exts`: extensions providing utility functions for common patterns.
    - Requires the `alloc` crate (either enable the `alloc` optional feature or your own custom allocator).

- `uefi-macros`: procedural macros that are used to derive some traits in `uefi`.

- `uefi-services`: provides a panic handler, and initializes the `alloc` / `logger` features.

- `uefi-test-runner`: a UEFI application that runs unit / integration tests.

## Documentation

The docs for the latest published crate version can be found at
[docs.rs/uefi/](https://docs.rs/uefi/)

This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

## Building and testing uefi-rs

Use the `cargo xtask` command to build and test the crate.

Available commands:
- `build`: build all the UEFI packages
  - `--release`: build in release mode
  - `--target {x86_64,ia32,aarch64}`: choose target UEFI arch
- `clippy`: run clippy on all the packages
  - `--target {x86_64,ia32,aarch64}`: choose target UEFI arch
  - `--warnings-as-errors`: treat warnings as errors
- `doc`: build the docs for the UEFI packages
  - `--open`: open the docs in a browser
  - `--warnings-as-errors`: treat warnings as errors
- `run`: build `uefi-test-runner` and run it in QEMU
  - `--ci`: disable some tests that don't work in the CI
  - `--disable-kvm`: disable hardware accelerated virtualization support in QEMU.
                     Especially useful if you want to run the tests under
                     [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) on Windows.
  - `--headless`: run QEMU without a GUI
  - `--ovmf-code <PATH>`: path of an OVMF code file
  - `--ovmf-vars <PATH>`: path of an OVMF vars file
  - `--release`: build in release mode
  - `--target {x86_64,ia32,aarch64}`: choose target UEFI arch
- `test`: run unit tests and doctests on the host

The `uefi-test-runner` directory contains a sample UEFI app which exercises
most of the library's functionality.

Check out the testing project's [`README.md`](uefi-test-runner/README.md) for
prerequisites for running the tests.
