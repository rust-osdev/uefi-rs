//! This module offers the [`Path`] and [`PathBuf`] abstractions.
//!
//! # Interoperability with Rust strings
//!
//! For the interoperability with Rust strings, i.e., `String` and `str` from
//! the standard library, the API is intended to transform these types first to
//! `CString16` respectively `CStr16`. They do not directly translate to
//! [`Path`] and [`PathBuf`].
//!
//! # Path Structure
//!
//! Paths use the [`SEPARATOR`] character as separator. Paths are absolute and
//! do not contain `.` or `..` components. However, this can be implemented in
//! the future.
