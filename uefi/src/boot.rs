//! These functions will panic if called after exiting boot services.
//!
//! # Accessing protocols
//!
//! Protocols can be opened using several functions in this module. Most
//! commonly, [`open_protocol_exclusive`] should be used. This ensures that
//! nothing else can use the protocol until it is closed, and returns a
//! [`ScopedProtocol`] that takes care of closing the protocol when it is
//! dropped.
//!
//! Other methods for opening protocols:
//!
//! * [`open_protocol`]
//! * [`get_image_file_system`]
//!
//! For protocol definitions, see the [`proto`] module.
