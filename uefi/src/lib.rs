//! Rusty wrapper for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.
//!
//! # Crate organisation
//!
//! The top-level module contains some of the most used types,
//! such as the result and error types, or other common data structures
//! such as GUIDs and handles.
//!
//! ## Tables and protocols
//!
//! The `table` module contains definitions of the UEFI tables,
//! which are structures containing some basic functions and references to other tables.
//! Most importantly, the boot services table also provides a way to obtain **protocol** handles.
//!
//! The `proto` module contains the standard UEFI protocols, which are normally provided
//! by the various UEFI drivers and firmware layers.
//!
//! ## Optional crate features
//!
//! - `alloc`: Enable functionality requiring the [`alloc`] crate from
//!   the Rust standard library. For example, methods that return a
//!   `Vec` rather than filling a statically-sized array. This requires
//!   a global allocator; you can use the `global_allocator` feature or
//!   provide your own.
//! - `global_allocator`: Implement a [global allocator] using UEFI
//!   functions. This is a simple allocator that relies on the UEFI pool
//!   allocator. You can choose to provide your own allocator instead of
//!   using this feature, or no allocator at all if you don't need to
//!   dynamically allocate any memory.
//! - `logger`: Logging implementation for the standard [`log`] crate
//!   that prints output to the UEFI console. No buffering is done; this
//!   is not a high-performance logger.
//! - `panic-on-logger-errors` (enabled by default): Panic if a text
//!   output error occurs in the logger.
//! - `unstable`: Enable functionality that depends on [unstable
//!   features] in the nightly compiler. Note that currently the `uefi`
//!   crate _always_ requires unstable features even if the `unstable`
//!   feature is not enabled, but once a couple more required features
//!   are stabilized we intend to make the `uefi` crate work on the
//!   stable channel by default.
//!   As example, in conjunction with the `alloc`-feature, this gate allows
//!   the `allocator_api` on certain functions.
//!
//! The `global_allocator` and `logger` features require special
//! handling to perform initialization and tear-down. The
//! [`uefi-services`] crate provides an `init` method that takes care of
//! this.
//!
//! ## Adapting to local conditions
//!
//! Unlike system tables, which are present on *all* UEFI implementations,
//! protocols *may* or *may not* be present on a certain system.
//!
//! For example, a PC with no network card might not contain a network driver,
//! therefore all the network protocols will be unavailable.
//!
